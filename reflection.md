# My Personal Event Reflection

## Activity Description
### What were the expectations and what did you do?

The expectations for the Spokane Cyber Cup were to use a variety of methods to capture these digital "flags" that were hidden in different ways based on the type of challenge. As this event catered to all skill levels, no prior experience was expected to participate in the event. So, the expectation was to come with an open mind, avoid using LLMs, and learn as much as possible. 

## Technical Decisions
### What decisions did you take from a technical perspective throughout this activity/event?

Throughout the competition, I made several technical decisions to help me succeed in learning, but also in successfully completing the challenges. One piece of advice given by the organizers, was to start with some of the tiered challenges. There were a handful of tiered challenges, so one I started with was the SQL injection series. This series had 3 total flags you could capture, with each flag having increasing difficulty to acquire. So, my main game plan was to do various tiered challenges to help me build up into harder challenges, and learn a topic in more depth. Other than that, I just went from one challenge to the next, reading forums and blogs on various exploits to help me solve the challenges. 

## Contributions
### Did you participate alone or with a team?

I initially was on the waitlist for the event as an individual. So, when finally getting off the waitlist I was placed on a random team. This team was meant to have 5 people, but actually ended up only having me and one other teammate for most of the event, with one additional individual who participated on our team for a short period of time. 

### If with a team, what were your specific individual contributions?

I contributed **92.8%** of my teams total points for the event, closing in at **9,787** points at the end of the event. My teams total points for the event was **10,537**.

## Quality Assessment
### How would you assess your participation in this event? What would you do differently if you could redo the event?

I believe I did really well during the event and was even surprised with my own performance. I completed **27** challenges on my own, and was almost in the running for top individual point contributor. I think that this is a great first Cyber Security CTF event performance. <br>
If I were to do an event like this again, or any other similar event, I would ideally find a team to sign up with. Having a more cohesive team would have allowed for a more collaborative environment, and also allow for more competition against the rest of the event, as most teams had 5 teammates. That being said, since I had less teammates contributing, I was able to do more challenges myself which allowed me to learn about several new exploits and vulnerabilities.
